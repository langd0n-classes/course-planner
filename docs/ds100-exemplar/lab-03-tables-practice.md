# Lab 03: Tables verification

## Purpose

Verify that students picked up the core table and DataFrame
skills from Lecture 06.
This lab uses a TA-led verification format: 5 guided questions
with live discussion, then 3 to 4 independent questions.
All questions are completion-graded.

## Why completion-graded

Students did not have a full GAIE prep cycle before Lecture 06.
Thursday was a traditional lecture, not a flipped session.
Completion grading reflects that this is the first hands-on
encounter, not a mastery check.

## Learning targets

- Read a DataFrame and explain what each column represents.
- Use exploration methods to inspect a dataset.
- Identify missing data and describe its impact.
- Frame a short claim supported by data evidence.

## Skills targeted in this meeting

- LM02-C02 Distinguish observations and variables, rows and
  columns.
- LM02-C04 Use basic exploration methods such as .head, .shape,
  .info, and .describe.
- LM02-C05 Select rows and columns using .iloc and column
  selection.
- LM02-C06 Check missing data using .isna or .isnull and count
  results.
- LM02-C08 Frame simple claims with evidence and limitations.

## Prep required of students

- Review Lecture 06 notes and any demo notebook.

## In-class plan (time-blocked)

- 0 to 5 min. TA introduces the activity and hands out sheets.
- 5 to 25 min. Guided phase: TA projects questions 1 to 5
  one at a time.
  Students write answers, then TA reveals and discusses each.
- 25 to 40 min. Independent phase: students work on questions
  6 to 9 at their own pace (printed on the answer sheet).
- 40 to 45 min. TA collects sheets or students photograph and
  submit via Gradescope.
- 45 to 50 min. Quick debrief and preview of LM-03.

## Instructor materials needed

- Verification slides (projected questions for guided phase).
- Printed answer sheets (questions 6 to 9 inline).
- A makeup version for absent students.

## Verification materials

- `lab-03/lab-03-verification-slides.md`
- `lab-03/lab-03-verification-answer-sheet.md`
- `lab-03/lab-03-verification-makeup.md`

## Grading

- All 9 questions completion-graded.
- Full marks for good-faith attempt on each question.
- TAs scan or collect and grade via Gradescope grouping.

## Release or due triggers (if any)

- Lab 03 verification submission due end of lab session.
