# Lecture 05: Programming basics

## Purpose

Provide a focused LM-01 catch-up session after the early cancellations.
This lecture covers the most essential programming foundations needed for
LM-02.

## Learning targets

- Use variables and assignment to store values.
- Identify basic data types and convert between them.
- Create and access a short list.
- Interpret a basic error message and explain a fix.

## Skills targeted in this meeting

- LM01-C01 Use variables and assignment to store values.
- LM01-C02 Work with basic data types such as int, float, str, and bool.
- LM01-C03 Apply type conversions to resolve type mismatches.
- LM01-C05 Create lists and access items by index.
- LM01-C08 Apply basic debugging habits in notebooks.

## Prep required of students

- Complete GAI-E01 Programming Concepts Bridge.
- Bring one example of a type error or list mistake.
- If you cannot run code yet, focus on concepts and questions.

## In-class plan (time-blocked)

- 0 to 10 min. Normalize the learning curve and reset expectations.
  What to lift:
  - `unreviewed/M04 - Programming Expanded.pdf` slides 2 to 4 for the
    learning curve and reassurance framing.
  - `unreviewed/M04 - Programming Expanded.pdf` slide 8 for Jupyter survival
    skills.
- 10 to 35 min. Variables, types, and conversion walkthroughs.
  What to lift:
  - `unreviewed/M02 - Programming Concepts.pdf` slides 10 to 16 for data
    types, int/float, and strings.
  - `unreviewed/M02 - Programming Concepts.pdf` slides 18 to 22 for assignment
    statements and variables are not equations.
- 35 to 55 min. Short list examples and why lists are limited for data work.
  What to lift:
  - `unreviewed/M05 - Functions, Jupyter, and Numbers.pdf` slides 13 to 15 for
    list basics and the table row connection.
- 55 to 70 min. Debugging practice and quick verification.
  What to lift:
  - `unreviewed/M04 - Programming Expanded.pdf` slide 12 for debugging as a
    skill.
  - `unreviewed/M02 - Programming Concepts.pdf` slides 31 to 33 for the
    verification structure and peer explanation check.
- 70 to 75 min. Wrap and preview of tables and claims.

## Instructor materials needed

- Slides or live notes with core examples.
- A small notebook or worksheet with short practice prompts.
- A short error diagnosis example that does not require Jupyter.

## Existing materials to reuse

- `lms/lm-01-programming-basics/lm01-overview.md`
- `lms/lm-01-programming-basics/lec-03-python-basics.md`
- `lms/lm-01-programming-basics/lec-04-data-types-lists.md`

## New materials required

- Updated lecture slides or annotated notes for the catch-up plan.
- A short in-class practice sheet or code prompts.

## Release or due triggers (if any)

- GAI-E01 completion check if used for readiness.
