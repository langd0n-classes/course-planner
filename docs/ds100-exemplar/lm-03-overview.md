# LM-03: Seeing Patterns in Data

## Internal Planning Section

- This overview treats LM-03 as a complete pattern-finding arc.
- Use this file as the single entry point for LM-03 materials.
- Keep the Blackboard content date-free and policy-neutral.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Filter and sort data to answer focused questions.
- Group data to compare categories and compute summaries.
- Create and interpret basic visualizations.
- Connect patterns to evidence-based claims.

## Module Timeline

- GAIE-02: Data manipulation exploration
  (released Tue Feb 3, due Tue Feb 10 8am)
- Lecture 07: Data manipulation (speedy lecture + activity)
- Lecture 08: Visualization basics (extends Lec 07, adds
  small verification)
- Lab 04: Patterns verification

## Learning Arc

- Explore (GAIE-02): AI-assisted exploration of filtering,
  sorting, groupby, and summary statistics.
- Consolidate (Lecture 07): Speedy lecture with live demos
  and a completion-graded in-class activity.
- Extend (Lecture 08): Visualization skills layered on top
  of manipulation, with a small correctness-graded
  verification.
- Verify (Lab 04): Fuller verification activity.

## Meetings in this module

- [Lecture 07: Data manipulation](lec-07-data-manipulation.md)
- [Lecture 08: Visualization basics](lec-08-visualization-basics.md)
- [Lab 04: Patterns practice](lab-04-patterns-practice.md)

## Skills from Skills Tracker

- LM03-C01 Filter rows and select columns using boolean
  indexing.
- LM03-C02 Sort data using .sort_values.
- LM03-C03 Group and aggregate data using .groupby and
  .reset_index.
- LM03-C04 Compute summary statistics such as mean, sum,
  count, value_counts, and mode.
- LM03-C05 Create basic charts such as bar, histogram,
  scatter, and line plots.
- LM03-C06 Interpret charts and describe patterns precisely.
- LM03-C07 Connect patterns to evidence-based claims.

## Notes

- GAIE-02 is the first GAIE on the normal release cadence
  (released the week before the module's first lecture).
- Lec 07 moves quickly because students arrive with GAIE
  prep; the in-class activity is completion-graded.
- Lec 08 adds visualization and includes a small
  correctness-graded verification.
- Lab 04 format to be determined (goal: engaging
  verification that is not a quiz).

## Overview

In this module you will learn to find and describe
patterns in data. You will filter, sort, and group
DataFrames to answer focused questions, then create
charts to make patterns visible. By the end you will
be able to connect what you see in data to evidence-based
claims.

## Learning Goals

- Filter and sort data to answer specific questions
- Group data and compute summary statistics
- Create basic charts (bar, histogram, scatter, line)
- Interpret charts and describe patterns precisely
- Connect patterns to claims with evidence and limitations
