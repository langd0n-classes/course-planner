# Lecture 07: Data manipulation

## Purpose

Build core data manipulation skills for pattern discovery.
Students arrive with GAIE-02 prep on filtering, sorting,
groupby, and summary stats.
This is a speedy lecture: move quickly through concepts
students have already explored, then spend time on a
hands-on activity.

## Learning targets

- Filter data using boolean conditions.
- Sort and group data to compare categories.
- Compute summary statistics to support claims.

## Skills targeted in this meeting

- LM03-C01 Filter rows and select columns using boolean
  indexing.
- LM03-C02 Sort data using .sort_values.
- LM03-C03 Group and aggregate data using .groupby and
  .reset_index.
- LM03-C04 Compute summary statistics such as mean, sum,
  count, value_counts, and mode.
- LM03-C07 Connect patterns to evidence-based claims.

## Prep required of students

- Complete GAIE-02 on data manipulation.
- Bring one question about filtering or grouping.

## In-class plan (time-blocked)

- 0 to 5 min. Quick check: what surprised you in GAIE-02?
  Surface common questions.
- 5 to 15 min. Live demo: filtering and sorting on a real
  dataset. Move fast since students have seen the syntax.
- 15 to 25 min. Live demo: groupby and summary stats.
  Emphasize the split-apply-combine pattern visually.
- 25 to 45 min. In-class activity: students answer 3 to 4
  data questions using filter, group, and sort on a shared
  dataset. Work individually or in pairs.
  Completion-graded (submit at end or check with TA).
- 45 to 50 min. Wrap: one interesting finding from the
  activity. Preview visualization in Lecture 08.

## Instructor materials needed

- Demo notebook with a real-world dataset.
- In-class activity prompts (3 to 4 questions).

## Existing materials to reuse

- `prior-art/M10/` for data manipulation slides and demos.
- `prior-art/M11/` for groupby in-class notebook.
- `prior-art/GAI-E04/` for dataset options.

## New materials required

- In-class activity worksheet or notebook with prompts.

## Release or due triggers (if any)

- GAIE-02 due before this lecture (Tue Feb 10 2pm).
