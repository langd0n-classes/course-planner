# LM-05: Quantifying Uncertainty

## Internal Planning Section

- This overview treats LM-05 as a complete uncertainty arc.
- Use this file as the single entry point for LM-05 materials.
- Keep the Blackboard content date-free and policy-neutral.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Apply basic probability rules to compute chances of
  simple events.
- Use simulation to approximate probabilities and explore
  randomness.
- Describe sampling variability and why sample statistics
  differ from sample to sample.
- Build and interpret bootstrap confidence intervals.
- Explain the logic of hypothesis testing at an
  introductory level.
- Connect uncertainty reasoning to evidence-based claims.

## Skills from Skills Tracker

- LM05-C01 Apply addition and multiplication rules to
  compute probabilities of simple events.
- LM05-C02 Distinguish independent and dependent events.
- LM05-C03 Use np.random to simulate random processes
  and estimate probabilities.
- LM05-C04 Explain the law of large numbers conceptually.
- LM05-C05 Distinguish population parameters from sample
  statistics.
- LM05-C06 Describe how sampling distributions narrow as
  sample size increases.
- LM05-C07 Construct and interpret a bootstrap confidence
  interval.
- LM05-C08 State the logic of a null hypothesis in plain
  language.

## Notes

- GAIE-04 and GAIE-05 use the modify-prompt pattern
  (mid-semester progression from copy-paste).
- Lab 06 uses a prediction tournament format (game-based).
- Lab 07 uses a gallery walk with TA verification.
- Boston employee salary dataset (boston-emp.csv) is the
  primary dataset for this module.
- Hypothesis testing is introduced at an introductory
  level in lec-13 and GAIE-05. LM-06 builds deeper.
- No pedagogy explanations in student-facing content.

## Overview

In this module you will learn to reason about
uncertainty using probability, simulation, sampling,
and bootstrap methods. You will estimate chances,
simulate random processes, explore how sample statistics
vary, and build confidence intervals. By the end you
will be able to connect uncertainty to evidence-based
claims about data.

## Learning Goals

- Apply basic probability rules to compute chances
- Use simulation to approximate probabilities
- Describe sampling variability and sampling distributions
- Build and interpret bootstrap confidence intervals
- Explain the logic of hypothesis testing
